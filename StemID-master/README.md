StemID and RaceID2 algorithms

RaceID2 is an advanced version of RaceID, an algorithm for the identification of rare and abundant cell types from single cell transcriptome data. The method is based on transcript counts obtained with unique molecular identifies.

StemID is an algorithm for the derivation of cell lineage trees based on RaceID2 results and predicts multipotent cell identites.

RaceID2 and StemID are written in the R computing language.
